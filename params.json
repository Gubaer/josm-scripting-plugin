{"name":"JOSM Scripting Plugin","body":"----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                        JOSM scripting plugin\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------                        \r\n\r\nThe scripting plugin executes scripts in JOSM.\r\n\r\nScripts can be defined in any scripting language, for which a JSR-223\r\ncompatible scripting engine is available.\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n=======\r\nPublished under GPL Version 3 and higher. See included LICENSE file.\r\n\r\nCREDIT\r\n======\r\nThis plugin uses:\r\n* jsyntaxpane by Ayman Al-Sairafi. See README.jsyntaxpane and LICENSE.jsyntaxpane\r\n* Rhino scripting engine by Mozilla Foundation. See README.rhino and LICENSE.rhino\r\n\r\nBUILD \r\n=====\r\n- copy 'build.properties.distrib' to 'build.properties' and adjust the build configuration\r\n  settings\r\n\r\n- run ant in the root directory\r\n    % ant dist\r\n    \r\nDEPLOY\r\n======\r\nThe latest build for the 'scripting' plugin should always be built on the branch 'deploy'\r\nand then pushed to GitHub. \r\n\r\nThe following steps mimic the deployment infrastructure JOSM uses for plugins maintained\r\non the OSM SVN site, see <http://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/DevelopersGuide/DevelopingPlugins>\r\nfor more info. JOSM reads meta-data about available plugins from <http://josm.openstreetmap.de/plugin>\r\nand the following steps ensure that the 'scripting' plugin is properly listed in this\r\nplugin directory. \r\n\r\nThere is a special branch 'deploy' for deploying.   \r\n  % git checkout deploy\r\n  % git merge master          # merge the development work from the branch 'master'\r\n  % ant dist                  # this creates dist/scripting.jar which is part\r\n                              # of the Git tree under this branch\r\n  % git push origin deploy    # Pushes the latest build to git hub  \r\n\r\nIf the build requires a minimal JOSM version, i.e. JOSM 1234, then run the following\r\nsteps:\r\n 1. Remember the current plugin version and the JOSM version it is compatible with by adding\r\n    a configuration entry to build.properties, i.e.\r\n      plugin.1111.requires=8888\r\n \r\n 1. Increase the plugin version in build.properties by setting the property 'plugin.version', i.e.\r\n      plugin.version=2222\r\n          \r\n 2. Set the lowest JOSM version the plugin is compatible. Use property 'josm.required.version' in\r\n    'build.properties', i.e.\r\n       josm.required.version=9999\r\n\r\nThe plugin Manifest will then include version information used by JOSMs plugin update system, for instance:\r\n\r\n    1111-Plugin-Url: 1111;https://raw.github.com/Gubaer/josm-scripting-plugin/for-josm-8888/dist/scripting.jar\r\n\r\nFinally, switch to branch deploy, merge and upload \r\n    % git checkout -f deploy\r\n    % git merge master\r\n    % git push origin\r\n    \r\nBuild the jar and push it too  \r\n    % ant dist                      # creates the scripting.jar, dependency specifications \r\n                                    # become part of the Manifest in the plugin                            \r\n    % git push origin deploy        # push the jar to Git Hub\r\n    \r\nTag the latest build and push the new tag     \r\n    % git tag for-josm-9999  HEAD   # tag the latest commit \r\n    % git push origin for-josm-999  # makes sure the latest build is tagged with 'for-josm-1234'\r\n    \r\nThis ensures, that the latest scripting plugin is available from \r\n    <https://raw.github.com/Gubaer/josm-scripting-plugin/deploy/dist/scripting.jar>\r\n    \r\nThe scripting plugin requiring JOSM 8888 is available from\r\n    <https://raw.github.com/Gubaer/josm-scripting-plugin/for-josm-8888/dist/scripting.jar>\r\n\r\nAUTHOR\r\n======\r\nKarl Guggisberg <karl.guggisberg@guggis.ch>\r\n\r\n \r\n                         ","tagline":"Run scripts in the Open Street Map editor JOSM.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
