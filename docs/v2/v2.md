# API V2


**API V2** consist of JavaScript functions and objects bundled in modules.

**API V2** can only be used with the `[Graal.JS]` scripting engine included in the plugin. 
It can't be used with other scripting engines, neither with Nashorn nor with the Rhino engine.

# The scripting context

The scripting context is is populated with the following object:
  
* `require()`

  `require()` is a global function to load [CommonJS Modules][CommonJS Module].


In contrast to the **API V1** there is no global `josm` object in the context. You
have to explicitly `require()` it:

```js
const josm = require('josm')
```

# JavaScript version

`Graal.JS` supports the latest JavaScript version, ECMAScript 2015 and later.

In contrast to former versions of the scripting plugin you can now use the
following JavaScript features with `Graal.JS`:

```js
// const keyword and object destructuring 
const { Api } = require('josm/api')

// let assignment
let counter = 0 
```

We recommend to use the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/). The **API V2**, for instance,

* uses 2 spaces for indentation
* uses single quotes for strings
* doesn't use semicolons
