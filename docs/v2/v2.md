# API V2


**API V1** consist of JavaScript functions and objects bundled in modules.

**API V1** can only be used with the `Graal.JS` scripting engine included in the plugin. 
It can't be used with other scripting engines, neither with Nashorn nor with the Rhino engine.

# The scripting context

The embedded scripting engine Rhino runs scripts in a *scripting context*.

The context is is populated with the following two objects:

* `josm`

  This global object represents the [running JOSM instance][josm].
  
* `require()`

  `require()` is a global function to load [CommonJS Modules][CommonJS Module].

# Beware of variables in the global scope

All variables declared outside of a function have global scope.

* Open the scripting console, run the following script, then close the console.

```js
const util = require("josm/util")
let counter = 1
util.println(`counter value: ${counter}`)
```

* Open the scripting console again and run the following script:

```js
const util = require("josm/util")
util.println(`counter value: ${counter}`)
```

The variable `counter` still exists in the global scope and the scripts still outputs `counter value: 1`.

  
You can use a **self-executing anonymous function** to make sure that your script doesn't polute the global scope and that there are no interferences with variables already defined in the global scope.

Here's an example for this pattern:

```js
(function() { // the self-executing anonymous function
  const util = require("josm/util")
  /*
   * counter is defined in the scope of the self-executing anonymous function,
   * not in the global scope
   */
  let counter = 1
  util.println(`counter value: ${counter}`)
})()
```
