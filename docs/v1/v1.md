# API V1

{% include v1-deprecated.md %}


**API V1** consist of JavaScript functions and objects bundled in modules.

**API V1** can only be used with the Rhino scripting engine included in the plugin. You can't use it with the Nashorn engine. It can't be used with the `Graal.JS` either.

# The scripting context

The embedded scripting engine Rhino runs scripts in a *scripting context*. There is only one
context for all scripts in JOSM. It is initialized when the Scripting Plugins starts up and 
destroyed when JOSM is terminated. 

The context is is populated with the following two objects:

* `josm`

  This global object represents the [running JOSM instance][josm].
  
* `require()`

  `require()` is a global function to load [CommonJS Modules][CommonJS Module].

# Beware of variables in the global scope

All variables declared outside of a function have global scope.

* Open the scripting console, run the following script, then close the console.

```js
var util = require("josm/util");
var counter = 1;
util.println("counter value: " + counter);
```

* Open the scripting console again and run the following script:

```js
var util = require("josm/util");
util.println("counter value: " + counter);
```

The variable `counter` still exists in the global scope and the scripts still outputs `counter value: 1`.

  
You can use a **self-executing anonymous function** to make sure that your script doesn't polute the global scope and that there are no interferences with variables already defined in the global scope.

Here's an example for this pattern:

```js
(function() { // the self-executing anonymous function
  var util = require("josm/util");
  /*
   * counter is defined in the scope of the self-executing anonymous function,
   * not in the global scope
   */
  var counter = 1;
  util.println("counter value: " + counter);
})();
```
